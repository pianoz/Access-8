			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>This app allows switching between modes, type either
			2,3, or 5 to select the number of switches you are capable of using.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Control scheme is as follows:
					<li>For 2 switch, the controls are 'a' (next), and spacebar (select). </li>
					<li>For 3 switch it is 'a' (prev), 'd' (next), and spacebar (select). </li>
					<li> For 5 switch it is 'w' (up), 's' (down), 'a' (left), 'b' (right), and spacebar (select)</li>
				</li>
				<li>Testing:
					<p> I tested both five switch and two switch methods, on my whole left hand versus my left index and middle fingers.
						 Each time I had to type in three equations, 7391+1803/2*12= and then timed the result. What I found made a good deal of sense.
						 Between three trials each, I got 37.75 seconds for the 2 control full left hand, versus 37.92 seconds for the 2 control two fingers.
						 since there are only two inputs anyway it makes sense that limiting to two fingers didn't exactly do much in terms of dropping
						 my time. For the five control scheme my full left hand got on average, 24.13 seconds, and my two fingers got 42.33 seconds. Since
						 I couldn't keep a finger on each key I had do to dome search and peck method to type out directions. This ate up a good chunk of time
						 and made it in fact slower than the two control with two fingers.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>Some things that might have affected the data for better or worse, I removed instances of error, All the runs I counted
				were perfect runs but the only one I left out was a big mistake with the full left hand. This also made me more cautious with
				my typing so that might have made it slower. I also picked equations with numbers very far apart which might have given an
				unfair advantage to the 5 control scheme which benifited from the up and down controls.
